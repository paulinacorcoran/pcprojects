        <p>
On October 13, 1999, I was born in Red Bank, NJ. I spent the first 18 years of my life in New Jersey with my mom, my dad, my brother, and our 2 cats and dog. Growing up, I always knew I loved New Jersey but I always dreamed of living somewhere new. Little did I know I would end up living in Miami for college! I did very well in school and always strived for top grades, which has translated into my college career. When I was younger, my goals and future career changed as often as the seasons. I always gravitated toward history, spanish, and english classes but I did not know what I wanted to do with my life. It wasnâ€™t until I went to a communications based high school that I had some more direction. I enjoy helping and communicating with people and I hope someday I will be able to turn this into a career!

        <p>
            In the future, I will ideally stay within the realm of communications. I would like to pursue my masters at the University of Miami in either marketing, communications, or public relations. I have taken a great interest in crisis communication and would like to pursue that more with my time left at the university and as a possible internship role in the future. I envision myself living in Miami for some time, then possibly moving to Los Angeles or to New York City! I am very excited to see all that lies beyond college.

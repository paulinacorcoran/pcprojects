              <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>My goal is to graduate from the University of Miami with at least a 3.3 GPA. I would love to apply for the Plus One scholarship to be able to continue my studies for another year for free, and perhaps persue another unrelated minor to my current choices. I see myself employed at a marketing agency, or perhaps a start-up of some kind. Learning more about business is an interest of mine and I have considered persuing a MBA. I would also like to further my knowledge of the stock market and real estate to learn how to make passive income. I see myself very happy in the future and possibly staying in Miami long term. I want my job experience to align with my interests and values and be something I don't view as my job, but what I am meant to do with my life.</p>

              <h2>Why Did I Choose UM</h2>
              <p> I chose to attend the University of Miami for many reasons. Primarily, I always knew I wanted to attend college far away from my home in New Jersey. To that point, I had never lived away from home or experienced truly being on my own. I wanted to pave my own way and start something for myself in a new city, and there truly is nothing like Miami. This city is not only beautiful, but features a central location to every sory of industry imaginable. The culture is extremely diverse and I have thouroughly enjoyed getting to know people from all geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds. There is also so much opportunity within the school to enrich yourself in clubs, social groups, and extracurricular activities. </p>

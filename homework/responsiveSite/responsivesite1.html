            <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>My name is Paulina Corcoran and I am a sophomore at the University of Miami. My major is Communication Studies and my two minors are marketing and human/social development. Some of my involvements on campus involve being the alumni relations chair for my sorority Delta Delta Delta, being a member of Alpha Lambda Delta, and working at Calling Canes. I'm excited to present my first functional site to feature some of my involvements, goals, and dreams while persuing my education at the University of Miami. </p>

            <h2>Purpose of Site</h2>
            <p> The purpose of this site is to discus my involvements, dreams, and goals on an online platform to make connections with current students, and put my best face forward for potential employers. I would ideally like to work and live in Miami beyond graduation, and I want to make these connections to get to know the area. Studying in Miami puts students at a competitive edge, and is just one of several reasons I decided to enroll. I am a dedicated worker who loves her school, and I hope the information listed on this site will help get that across.</p>

                There’s far more to the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic than sandy beaches and rum bars. Simultaneously Caribbean, colonial, and cultural, the country also boasts a diverse array of natural landscapes, with scenery that oscillates between fertile farmland, forest-shrouded waterfalls, and majestic mountains. Punta Cana, the country’s easternmost tip, entices travelers with idyllic beaches and luxury resorts. It’s also an ideal launching point for a handful of adventurous day trips, and active travelers will love the variety of recreation-based tours available. Explore off-road terrain in a dune buggy, take a catamaran cruise to Saona Island, go for a swim at El Limon Waterfall, or careen through the treetops on one of the longest ziplining circuits in the Caribbean. Tours to Catalina Island, where you can snorkel above a pristine coral reef, depart from Punta Cana, too. The island capital of Santo Domingo, home to a colonial Old Town that’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is just two hours from Punta Cana. Sightseeing tours that include transportation allow visitors to hit many of its top attractions such as Calle de las Damas, Columbus Lighthouse, and Cathedral of Santa Maria la Menor (Catedral Primada de América) in one day. Santo Domingo is also a logical gateway to Lago Enriquillo and Isla Cabritos National Park (inhabited by crocodiles, flamingos, and iguanas), and tours that combine both mean you don’t have to choose between them.

              Like many traditions that have survived in the Dominican Republic, the cuisine is a blend of Spanish, African and even Taíno influences. The particular type of cuisine is known as comida criolla, which is also found in other Caribbean areas and adapts classic Spanish and African recipes to indigenous ingredients and Taino cooking methods. Dominican cuisine is generally heavy on starches, and the commonly used starches include rice, potatoes, yucca, cassava and bananas. One of the most popular dishes in the Dominican Republic -- and one you'll find on nearly every restaurant menu -- is la bandera ("the flag"). La bandera is a meal of stewed meat over white rice with beans (usually red beans), fried green plantains and salad. Another common dish is a sweet bean soup with root vegetables known as habichuela con dulche. And the Dominicans' variation on the Spanish dish of paella is known as locrio, which uses rice colored with achiote instead of saffron. Bananas and plantains are especially popular in the Dominican Republic, and are commonly boiled, stewed and candied. Popular meats in the Dominican Republic are pork, beef, chicken and even goat. A roast pork dish, known as lechon asado, is particularly popular, as well as cuchifrito, which is a stew of pork innards. Roast beef served with ham, onion and spice garnish is known as carne mechada. Goat meat stewed with a tomato sauce or roast leg of goat with rum and cilantro are also favorites. Even though the Dominican Republic isn't considered one of the world's culinary leaders, you'll find plenty of delicious local fare to feast on!
